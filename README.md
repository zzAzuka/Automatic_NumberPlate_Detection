ANPR, or license plate recognition (LPR), has proven to be one of the more effective methods for vehicle monitoring in recent years. It can be used in many public areas to achieve various goals, such as automatic vehicle parking, automated toll text collecting, traffic safety enforcement, and car parks.
ANPR algorithms typically consist of four steps: (1) capturing an image of a vehicle; (2) greyscaling; (3) contouring/masking; and (4) converting the image into text. The first step, which is to take a picture of the vehicle, appears to be quite simple, but it is actually a very demanding task because it is very challenging to take a picture of a moving vehicle in real-time so that no part of it, especially the license plate, is missed.
The ability of the second and third steps to detect the car number plate and distinguish each character determines the effectiveness of the fourth step. These systems use various techniques to identify the number plate from the car and then retrieve the vehicle number from the picture. Here, we'll use OpenCV software to isolate and mask the license plate from the picture, and then EasyOCR to turn the masked plate into text so that it can be entered into the database.
